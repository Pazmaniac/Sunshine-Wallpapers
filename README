sunlight
=======================

Project includes 3D live wallpaper for OpenGL ES 2.0 capable androind devices.

Your very own sun
=======================

This application is a 3D live wallpaper. It renders sun as well as other star types using OpenGL ES 2.0.

Live animated Sun can be configured. You can change size, color, animation speed, corona size, turbulence and many more options.

Usage: Home->Press Menu->Wallpapers->LiveWallpapers.
You can open settings by double tapping on the screen.

If your device supports non squared textures, consider using this options  all the time.
Post effects may cause performance issues on slow  devices.
But you can turn them off  in the settings menu.

Wallpaper should work properly on HTC Desire and Nexus 7 devices.
If you have problems on your device please email me.

Code based on my previous projects blurred-lines-live (https://github.com/ghisguth/blurred-lines-live) and the-grid-live (https://github.com/ghisguth/the-grid-live). Hope they will me merged into this project in future.

Some code and resources was borrowed from other projects. Here is the list of the one which I can recall:

* Live Wallpaper Open GL support used from andenginelivewallpaperextensio project
(http://code.google.com/p/andenginelivewallpaperextension).
* Detailed information on GLSurfaceView adaption for 3D Live Wallpapers:
